This is a python program to calculate the Net Present Value.
Net present value of a set of cashflows is the total discounted value of all flows, where each flow is discounted (divided by) the interest rate compounded by time. NetPresentValue() takes a list of values, and an interest rate (in decimal), and returns the net present value.
